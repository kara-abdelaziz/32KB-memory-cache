# Cache memory in Logisim
This project consists of recreating a Cache Memory on the Logisim simulation software. 
Thanks to Logisim, it allows an educational and detailed way to understand the internal functioning of a cache memory, 
and helps understanding its uses as the temporary and fast memory data between the processor and the RAM.
